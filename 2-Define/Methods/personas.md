## Personas

#### What is it?
A persona is typically defined by the user's role in the organization but this isn't always the case. It represents a group of users with same business goals. 

#### Why do you use it?
During user interviews you might find that multiple users of the same role can have different priorities, motivations and pain points. By creating a persona for a group of users, you define what the common goals and needs of the group are. Personas define who you are designing for.

#### When to do it?
Personas should be created after conducting user interviews and reviewing notes. 

#### How to do it?
The following elements should be included in a persona card:

* Title - Persona's role in the organization

## Organization Chart

#### What is it?
This is a diagram that maps the people in an organization, the relationship between them and hierarchy in the organization.

#### Why do you use it?
To understand the relationship or hierarchy between the different roles involved in the project.

#### When to do it?
Requesting or drafting an org chart at the beginning of the process can be very helpful. This can be either before or after the user interviews. 

#### How to do it?
List the users and their roles. Draw the relationship between (for example, who reports to whom?) and orgranize them to start with the highest role going down to the lowest role.

## Business Terms Diagram



#### What is it?
Business terms diagram is a method for organizing the definitions of and relationships between specific business terms, which could include measures and dimensions. It usually puts these terms in the context of a larger business process, rather than simply listing terms and their definitions. 

#### Why do you do it?
When there are terms & definitions that are very specific to the business, or are not clear/straightforward in their meanings and contexts, it is helpful to organize them in a diagram to 1) confirm understanding with the client, 2) map data points back to a business process or context, and 3) quickly pass on information to other people on the team regarding new terms and their definitions.

#### When to do it?
A Business Terms Diagram can be created after the "Understand the Business" phase or after the entire Understand phase. 

#### How to do it?
The format of the Business Terms Diagram will vary from client to client, depending on the designer's discretion regarding how best to model and display the terms. 
1. Identify the business terms that you want to add clarity to.
2. Collect information about the business process around those terms, such as:
    * Steps in the process
    * Conditions or triggers
    * Roles in the process and their responsibilities
3. Create an artifact that defines terms in the context of the process.

## Card Sorting

#### What is it?
Card sorting is a technique discovering how the users understand, categorize and prioritize information. Unlike, affinity mapping, the information on the cards needs to be pre-decided before the card sorting session starts.

#### Why do you do it?
During the understand phase, the design team often collects huge amount of information from both user interviews and existing documents. Card sorting helps the team figure out a way to organize the information that makes the most sense to the users.

#### When to do it?
It could be conducted during the interview with if the team is onsite, which requires the team to produce the cards beforehand, or it could be conducted internally after the interview is done. 


#### How to do it?

1. Before the card sorting session begins, the team needs to first produce the cards.

###### What could the cards represent

  * Key questions to answer
  * Data elements
    * Measure
    * Dimension
    * Measure by Dimension
  * Tasks
  * Reports
  * Ideas (for Diverge phase)

2. Then the team also needs to decide which type of card sorting session to run. For an internal session, the team can run an open or hybrid card sorting session to explore all meaningful categories. When interviewing users, closed card sorting might be better since it is more structured and the users can focus more on sorting the information rather than thinking what categories there could be. But at the end of a closed card sorting session, the lead of the session can still ask participants if they would rephase the categories, or if they would combine certain categories.

###### Open / Closed / Hybrid Card Sorting

* Open card sort: Participants sort cards into categories that make sense to them, and label each category themselves
* Closed card sort: Participants sort cards into categories you give them
* Hybrid card sort: Participants sort cards into categories you give them, and can create their own categories as well

3. The team also needs to come up with the meaningful categories for the card sorting. This can happen before the session, during the session, or both.
###### What could the categories be

* Needs / Wants / Desires
  
   Start with a feature wish list and condense into columns of priority for "Needs"(aka Must Haves, Top Priority), "Wants"(Nice to Haves), "Desires" (Would love to have someday...). This activity is great for ironing out which features are most important and which could potentially be put on the back burner list.
  
* Available / Possible / Out of Scope

   The team needs to understand the readiness and availability of the back end - What is "Available" (achievable in near future), "Possible" (achievable with extra effort on the back end), and "Out of Scope" (technically unrealistic to pursue). This grouping can also be combined with the Needs/Wants/Desires one, to further iron out the priority.
  
* Timeframe (Daily / Monthly / Quarterly / Annual | Short-term / Long-term)
* Business Functions
* Strategic / Operational
* Analytical / Exploratory
* High Level / Detail

4. Pool all the cards together without overlapping, and place a set of categories on a whiteboard.
5. Ask the participants to pick up cards and arrange them on the whiteboard under the categoties.
6. Evaluate the sorting:
  * Are all the cards categorized? If not, are those not categorized cards important? 
  * Does the sorting make sense to everybody?
7. Take a picture and move on to the next set of categories.

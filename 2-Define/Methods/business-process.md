## Business Process Mapping

#### What is it?
Business process mapping, a part of Business Process Management (BPM), is a framework used to create visual representations of work processes. Business process maps show the relationship between the steps and inputs to produce an end-product or service, such as when a product goes through packaging or when an employeeâ€™s leave is approved. 

#### Why do you do it?
By mapping out the client's business process, the team can better understand what a business does, why it does what it does, what the standard is for success, who is responsible, and when and where different steps will occur. A business process could involve multiple personas, therefore understanding it can help the team understand relationship and differences between the personas.<br>
It is also a great way to demonstrate our knowledge to the stakeholders.

#### When to do it?
Business process mapping could be done during the business SME interview, a user interview, or after the interviews in the define phase. 

#### How to do it?
Remember that the business process map can be created at different levels
* Cross functional process - across multiple business functions   
* Single function and multi role process - within one business function but involves users of different roles  
* Single role process - within a single business function and for a specific user role  

1. Identify the business process you want to map out, and define a start and end point. Start at the highest level. 
2. Collect information about the process:
    * Steps in the process
    * Conditions or triggers
    * Roles in the process and their responsibilities
    * Input needed during the process (such as key data elements)
    * Output produced during the process (such as actions taken or decisions made)
3. Connect the steps with arrows
4. Mark collected details on the lines

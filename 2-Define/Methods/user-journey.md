## User Journey Mapping

#### What is it?
User journey mapping is a process to deconstruct a userâ€™s experience with a product or service into a series of phases or steps, and along the phases or steps it highlights user's goals, thoughts, feelings/emothions. 

#### Why do you do it?
It can help the designers understand the user's experience from multiple angles, not just what the user needs to do but also what the user thinks or feels. It also helps the team communicate our understanding or our vision of the user experience with the client.

#### When to do it?
A user journey map could be created in the define phase, after personas are defined, to decribe the persona's current journey. Or it could be built in the validate phase after the design is produced, to demonstrate the intended user experience.

#### How to do it?
1. Identify the persona's goal, and define a start and end point for the journey.
2. Build a table with phases or steps through time on the horizontal axis, and the themes of "Actions," "Feelings," and "Pain Points" on the vertical axis.

## Card Sorting

#### What is it?
Card sorting is a technique discovering how the users understand, categorize and prioritize information. This method helps understand a user's mental model for organizing information and can help structure information in a way that makes it easy to find.

#### Why do you do it?
Card sorting can provide insight on how people organize content and information which can help inform the information architecture of an application. 
Card sorting can be useful in the following scenarios: 
* Build the overall structure and navigation for your application
* Decide what to put on each tab
* Organize information in the form of cards or tiles
* Label objects such as charts or tiles

#### When to do it?
It can be  used in the Converge and Prototype phase when you are tying to test how to organize newly drawn up concepts.
It can also be done during the Undertand phase if you are trying to improve an existing application's Information Architecture of an existing application.

#### How to do it?

1. Before the card sorting session begins, the team needs to first produce cards. According to [NNgroup](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/), these cards should contain  40â€“80 items that represent the main content of the application. Write each topic on an individual index card.

> These index cards could represent
>  * Names of sections of the application
>  * Names of tiles on a page
>  * Key questions answered by charts
>  * Description of chart objects
>  * Data elements
>    * Measure
>   * Dimension
>   * Measure by Dimension

2. Ask the user to  organizes cards into groups. Shuffle the cards and give them to the participant. Ask the user to look at the cards one at a time and place cards that belong together in one pile. 

3. Categorize or label the piles based on the type of card sort you chose to conduct. Open or hybrid card sorting can be used to to explore all meaningful categories. Closed card-sorting sessions on the other hand can provide more structure and focus to the session. At the end of a closed card sorting session, the lead of the session can still ask participants if they would rephase the categories, or if they would combine certain categories.

>###### Open / Closed / Hybrid Card Sorting
> * Open card sort: Participants sort cards into categories that make sense to them, and label each category themselves
> * Closed card sort: Participants sort cards into categories you give them
> * Hybrid card sort: Participants sort cards into categories you give them, and can create their own categories as well

4. It is important to remind the user that they can move cards around between groups as they are performing the card sort. They are also not required to categorize/group all cards and it is okay to have a pile of unknown cards.

5. At the end of a card sorting session you may talk to the user to try and understand their rationale behind grouping cards together.

5. Repeat this process for about 15-20 users and then analyze the results.

6. Analyze the results from card sorts to see common categories across participants.

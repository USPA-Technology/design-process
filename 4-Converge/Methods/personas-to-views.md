## Map Personas to Views

#### What is it?
This is a method used to map personas to views based on goals and tasks. It is a communication tool that outlines the "rooms" that each visualization and user is intended to live in. 

#### Why do you do it?
The team needs to map the views back to personas to make sure:
* Their business goals can be achieved with these views
* Their workflows are optimized (avoid situations like every persona is going to every view to fetch pieces of information) 

#### When to do it?
After views are decided. Concepts of visualizations do not necessarily need to be finalized yet. 

#### How to do it?
1. Summarize each view with 
    * business goals that could be achieved with this view
    * or high level tasks that can be accomplished in this view 
    * or key questions that can be answered in this view 
2. Pick one persona and match the persona with views via business goals, tasks or key questions
3. Connect the persona to views and weight the lines by frequency of use or priority of the goals achieved in each view
4. After all personas are mapped to views, mark each view with colored dots. Each color represents a persona, and the dots have 3 forms that represent whether this persona is a primary user, a secondary user, or not an intended user of this view.

If a [Task Analysis](design-process/2-Define/Methods/task-analysis.md) was performed, you can consider using the views to reference the exact tasks that will be performed on each screen.

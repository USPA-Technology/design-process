## Views summary

#### What is it?
This is a method used to summarize the different views within the application and who the users of views are. It is a communication tool that outlines the "rooms" that each visualization and user is intended to live in. 

#### Why do you do it?
* Provides a framework for where your visualization concepts can be placed 
* Ensure that business goals and tasks can be achieved with these views
* Starting point to optimize workflows (avoid situations like every persona is going to every view to fetch pieces of information) 

#### When to do it?
After views are decided. Concepts of visualizations do not necessarily need to be finalized yet. 

#### How to do it?
1. Summarize each view with 
    * business goals that could be achieved with this view
    * or high level tasks that can be accomplished in this view 
    * or key questions that can be answered in this view 
2. List the primary users of the views below the views. These are the users for whom the screen is designed for. 
3. List the secondary users of the views below the primary users. These are users that might additionally use the screen but the screen was not designed for them.

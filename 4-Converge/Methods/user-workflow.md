## User Workflow

#### What is it?
A user workflow (or user flow) illustrates how a user walks through the designed solution to accomplish tasks or achieve business goals. Each persona should have a separate user workflow. 

#### Why do you do it?
A user workflow enables the design team to demonstrate to the client how and why our design (or design in working progress) works for the users. It ties the design back to the personas so that the audience can see our design decisions are well supported by our research.

#### When to do it?
After views are generated if the flow remains at the view level, or after high fidelity mockups are produced if the flow dives deeper into components in the views. It is also a time consuming method, therefore the team can only do it when time allows.<br>
User workflow could be combined with the views summary and the personas to views mapping. 

#### How to do it?
1. Lay out the views (or components) the persona needs to use.
2. Number the views (or components) in logical sequence.
3. Connect the views (or components) with arrows.
4. Mark details on the lines, like:
  * frequency of use
  * triggers or conditions
  * actions or thoughts

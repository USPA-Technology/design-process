## User Workflow

#### What is it?
A user workflow (or user flow) illustrates how a user walks through the designed solution to accomplish tasks or achieve business goals. Each persona should have a separate user workflow. 

#### Why do you do it?
A user workflow enables the design team to demonstrate to the client how and why our design (or design in working progress) works for the users. It helps define paths in which a user would use the various screens within an app. They can be linear or non-linear with various decision points.It ties the design back to the personas so that the audience can see our design decisions are well supported by our research. 

#### When to do it?
After views are generated if the flow remains at the view level, or after high fidelity mockups are produced if the flow dives deeper into components in the views. It is also a time consuming method, therefore the team can only do it when time allows.<br>
User workflow could be combined with the views summary.

#### How to do it?
1. Lay out the views (or components) the persona needs to use. The views can be laid out based on the level of detail(eg:high level screens at the top to detailed screens at the bottom), persona associated with it etc. Views can also be grouped based on the primary persona or the frequency of use. 
2. Number the views (or components) in logical sequence.
3. Add high level tasks/questions to each view.
3. Connect the views (or components) with arrows.
4. Mark details on the lines, like:
  * frequency of use
  * triggers or conditions
  * actions or thoughts
  * primary and secondary screens

## Diverge: Illuminating all possible paths

The Diverge phase gives people on the team space to digest the information and brainstorm on their own, allowing for ideas to be formed without being hindered by others’ opinions. Our goal is to explore as many ideas as possible, all from different perspectives and approaches, regardless of how unfeasible or untraditional they may be - it may happen that one person's idea could spark another, or contribute to someone else's idea. Also, once we begin eliminating some of these options in the next phase, we are given reason to be more confident, since we'll have explored so many alternatives.

* Have a mindset of "Yes" and constantly ask “How might we?”

## Input/Output

#### Inputs/Prerequisites:

###### Personas, Tasks, and Key Questions: 
The team should familiarize themselves with each persona's goals, tasks, and key questions, as these are what will lay the groundwork for the Diverge phase. 

#### Outputs/Artifacts:

###### Visualization Concepts: 
Each team member should organize their ideas on either paper, whiteboard, or Sketch -- whatever works best for sharing and discussion.

## Methods in Diverge Phase

#### Exploratory Research

Before sketching ideas, each individual can search online for visualization examples that answer similar business questions.


#### [Mind Mapping](/3-Diverge/Methods/mind-mapping.md)
A warm up exercise to start generating ideas. People are given time to individually explore the problem however they choose to.


#### [Crazy Eights](../3-Diverge/Methods/crazy-8s.md)
Borrowed from Google Ventures’ book, Sprint, this exercise, each member takes a sheet of printer paper, folds it in half 3 times to get 8 rectangles. They then have 5 minutes to sketch out ideas for a specific feature or flow in a product. After they’re done, they share with the team.


#### [Affinity Mapping](../1-Understand/Methods/affinity-mapping.md)
Affinity mapping can also be used in this phase to collect and organize ideas from designers (instead of answers from interviewees). 

#### [Storyboard](../2-Define/Methods/storyboard.md)
Sometimes two or multiple concepts could be used to answer one business question. A storyboard can be used in this case to group these concepts and tell a story.

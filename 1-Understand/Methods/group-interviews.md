## Group Interviews

#### What is it?
Group interviews are similar to user interviews but have have multiple users. 

#### Why do you use it?
Ideally, you get to interview the users one on one through user interviews. In situations where it is not possible to conduct user interviews, group interviews can be a substitute. You might be forced to use group interviews if the stakeholder is insistent on having multiple users interviewed at the same time, there are time and budget constraints, or if the users are not willing to particiapte in one on one interviews. Group interviews have their drawbacks. You risk only hearing the opinion of the most influential person in the room, or the most talkative, other users responses may be biased based on what everyone else is saying, some users might not feel comfortable in a group setting, or might not be as honest with their opnions as they fear a breach of confidentiality.

#### When to do it?
Group interviews are conducted in the research phase of the project.

#### How to do it?
Group interviews work best with a group of users who work cloesly together,have similar roles, have equal infuence and are impacted by the project in similar ways.  During the session, a designer should lead the conversation and ask questions, and another resource should take comprehensive notes for later discussion. The questions asked during the group interviews can be similar to user interview questions. With group interviews, be sure to moderate the session and ensure that everyone get to voice their thoughts. You might have to steer the conversation if it starts going off topic. If you notice users who are hestitant to share their opinions, you can send them a follow note to get their thoughts or even have seperate one on one interview with them.

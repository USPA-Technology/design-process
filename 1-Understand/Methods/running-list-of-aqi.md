## Running List of AQI

This running list includes any assumptions, questions and ideas that were formed during the Pre-Engagement phase. It will evolve with the project, with items being added and resolved as the engagement progresses. The team can use this list to help guide interviews, keep track of what is learned, and support future design decisions.

A spreadsheet is useful for capturing this information in a table format, like so:

| 				| 				| Who to Ask/Confirm With | Follow Up Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------			  | ------------a- 	|
| Assumption 	| Assumption 1  | 			  |  	|						
|  				| Assumption 2  | 			  |  	|
| Key Ideas		| Idea 1	    | 			  |  	|
|  				| Idea 2	    |			  |  	|
| Key Questions	| Question 1    |			  |  	|
|  				| Question 2    |			  |  	|

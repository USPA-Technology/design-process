## Desk Research

#### What is it?
Desk research is the act of discovering information about the client through the means of online information. Research can be about the company, industry, business function, and client history.

#### Why do you use it?
Desk research can help inform research questions, bring team members up to speed about common metrics and terms, and potentially provide context for how scoping and design decisions are prioritized. 

#### When to do it?
Before the project begins or prior to interviews.

#### How to do it?

Try using the following resources:

#### 1. Annual Report / 10K Report / 10Q Report
For public companies, these financial reports are available online (usually easy to find with a simple google search). Annual report or 10K report provides a high level view of past year's operation, business strategies, major business issues and certified financial details. A 10Q report provides similar information for the past quarter. 

Example:
[GE 10K Report](http://www.ge.com/ar2016/10k-highlights/)


#### 2. Business Model Canvas Questionnaire
The [Business Model Canvas](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/10/canvas1.gif) is a useful tool to understand a business as a whole. By filling out questions around the company's key activities, value propositions, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue stream, the team will gain a comprehensive understanding of how the business is run, and what in particular is important.

If can't to find all the answers with online research, the designer can use this canvas to guide pre-kickoff meetings with SD, SME or client champion to collect information more effectively. 

#### 3. Key Metrics & Definitions in Industry or Business Domain
To establish a baseline of understanding and start interviews with a common language, it'll be important for team members to research basic terms, definitions and common metrics within the industry and/or business domain.

## Contextual Inquiry

#### What is it?
Contextual Inquiry is an observational method that seeks to understand users in the environment where they will use your product e.g. in their home or their office. This method allows you to better understand the context that a user operates in and can allow you to obtain more realistic insights than say interviews where users are removed from the product and are relying on recollection to describe their behaviour.

#### Why do you use it?
We can use this method to understand real user behaviour versus studying them in an unfamiliar enviornment such as a lab. This method lets you capture tacit insights about their context of use beyond the things a user explivitly says. You may also use this method if it is hard for the user to schedule time 

#### When to do it?
* You may use this method in the understand phase to empathise with the user and capture unmet needs.
* It can also be used in the validation phase to observe the impact of your design on the user and identify usability issues that could be addressed.

#### How to do it?

Before the session you may set expectations with a user that you want to shadow them as they work. Let them know that you may ask them questions as you observe them.

Be prepared to take notes during the interview or have an assigned note-taker during the session.

Watch the user as they interact with a report or application. Ask questions during the session to get a better sense of how they interact with the report and when they get stuck. If Here are some example questions that can help with observation

What is the first thing you look at?
What does it measure?
What is the comparison that tells you whether it is good or bad?
What is the next thing you look at if it is good/bad?
Repeat till the next step is outside of this report/app.

Be sensitive to their workflow. You want to ask questions but you also want to be mindful about not interrupting them so much.

This exercise isn't limited to the Understand phase, but also can be applied in the Validate phase.

## Modelstorming

#### What is it?
Modelstorming is a conversation between business users and data experts to brainstorm on the data model based on how it relates to business events. It will be led by the Axis developer on the team.

#### Why do you use it?
By gathering data requirements based on business events, instead of collecting them in isolation, we will be able to create a shared language amongst business users, designers, and developers alike. It will lay a foundation for tying together business goals, user needs, and data elements.

#### When to do it?
After the Business SME interview conducted by the designer.

#### How to do it?

Refer to the Axis developer to guide session. Reference [Agile BI Guru](https://agilebi.guru/gathering-data-requirements/) and the [Axis BEAM & UX Design](https://github.com/axisgroup/design-process/blob/master/Resources/BEAM-and-UX-design.pdf) Whitepaper for more information.

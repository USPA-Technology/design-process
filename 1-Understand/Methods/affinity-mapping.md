## Affinity Mapping

#### What is it?
Affinity mapping, also know as affinity diagram, is a guided exercise where information is gathered from multiple participants and then grouped into meaningful categories. 

#### Why do you use it?
Collecting information from multiple people can be time consuming and inefficient, because as the more people involved the more time is spent on communication. Affinity mapping allows all participants to provide answers to specific questions at the same time. It reduces effort on communication and increases productivity. 

#### When to do it?
* Affinity mapping can be utilized during a group interview, where the design team can prompt questions and collect answers from multiple interviewees. 
* It can also be used during the diverge phase, where the designers can generate and group ideas.

#### How to do it?
Here are the steps to run an Affinity Mapping process:

* A designer will play the role of the facilitator and write down questions on a big whiteboard, like 
  * What's the first thing you look at on a typical Monday morning?
  * What is your primary success criteria?
  * What do you worry about on a daily/monthly/quarterly basis?
 
> Other ideas include making lists of the following elements:
> * Key questions to answer
> * Data elements
>   *  Measure
>   *  Dimension
>   *  Measure by Dimension
>   *  Tasks
>   *  Reports

* The users write down their answers on sticky notes, and put them on the whiteboard. 
* The group talk through their answers.
* Rearrange the sticky notes to explore meaningful themes.
* Name themes and finish affinity diagram.

> Themes tend to emerge organically as one is conducting the exercise. The following list offers some inspiration around what these could be:
> * Needs / Wants / Desires
>
> Start with a feature wish list and condense into columns of priority for "Needs"(aka Must Haves, Top Priority), "Wants"(Nice to Haves), "Desires" (Would love to have someday...). This activity is great for ironing out which features are most important and which could potentially be put on the back burner list.
> * Available / Possible / Out of Scope
> The team needs to understand the readiness and availability of the back end - What is "Available" (achievable in near future), "Possible" (achievable with extra effort on the back end), and "Out of Scope" (technically unrealistic to pursue). This grouping can also be combined with the Needs/Wants/Desires one, to further iron out the priority.
> * Timeframe (Daily / Monthly / Quarterly / Annual | Short-term / Long-term)
> * Business Functions
> * Strategic / Operational
> * Analytical / Exploratory
> * High Level / Detail

Pool all the cards together without overlapping, and place a set of categories on a whiteboard.
Ask the participants to pick up cards and arrange them on the whiteboard under the categoties.
Evaluate the sorting:
Are all the cards categorized? If not, are those not categorized cards important?
Does the sorting make sense to everybody?
Take a picture and move on to the next set of categories.

This exercise isn't limited to the Understand phase, but also can be applied in the Diverge phase. The team can use this approach to collect and group visual concepts.

## Surveys

#### What is it?
Surveys are a mean of data collection. They comprise of a list of questions that are sent out to users. 

#### Why do you use it?

#### When to do it?
Surveys can be conducted as part of the research phase. They can be sent out before user interviews to capture information on the users process, pain points etc. Follow-up questions based on the results of the survey can be asked during the interviews. Surveys may also be sent out after user interviews to get different perspectives on key themes that came up during the interviews. The use of surveys in not just limted to the research phase. They can be used during the validate phase to capture feedback on the application. 

#### How to do it?
Create a list of questions you want to send out to the users. You can use online tools like Survey Monkey, Google forms. 
Your survey can include  mix of open ended/qualitative questions as well as close ended/quantitative questions. 

##### Open ended/ qualitative questions
Open ended questions let the users type in any type of response in the form of a paragraph, lines etc. Open ended questions give you insight into the "why" and are less restrictive. Analyzing responses can be harder and more time consuming with this type of question. Following up a quantiative question with an open ended qualitative question can give you insight into why that response was chosen. Using too many open ended questions might lead to users not completing the surveys since they are more time consuming to answer. 

##### Close ended/quantitative questions
Close ended questions can be answered with a fixed set of options like yes/no, a likert scale, checkboxes, radio buttons etc. They are useful when trying to quantify things and are used to collect facts. They make data analysis easier and are also easier and quicker to respond to. 

##### Tips
* Use language that’s easy to understand  
* Order the questions to have some logical flow  
* Use a neutral tone that will not bias the user  
* Front load the most important questions in case people lose interest  
* Keep the survey length short  
* Include options like don’t know, not applicable

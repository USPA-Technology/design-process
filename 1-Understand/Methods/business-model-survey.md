## Business Model Canvas Survey

#### What is it?
The Business Model Canvas is a useful tool to understand a business as a whole.

#### Why do you use it?
To gain a comprehensive understanding of how the business is run, and what in particular is important.

#### When to do it?
Before the project begins, prior to interviews, or during a business SME interview.

#### How to do it?
Download and print the [Business Model Canvas](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/10/canvas1.gif) and fill out questions around the company's key activities, value propositions, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue stream. Do what is possible with online research, or use the canvas as a guide during SME interviews, either with an internal SME or a client champion, so as to more effectively collect information.

# Design Implementation Support: Documentation of the design
The Design Implementation Support phase encompasses all efforts towards supporting development once the design prototype is approved by the client. This might entail continued oversight on development and ensuring that the development is as per specifications. In addition to availability to support and answer any questions or concerns faced during development, any documentation required to turn over development responsibilities to internal teams shall be created in this phase.

## Methods in Design Implementation Support Phase

#### [User Stories](../2-Define/Methods/user-stories.md)

User stories can document all the features the app needs to support. The design team can use user stories to communicate with developers. 

#### [Use Case](../2-Define/Methods/use-cases.md)

Similar to user stories, use cases can also be used as documentation of design features to facilitate communication between designers and developers. 

#### [Design Specifications Document](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/design-specs.md)

Design specs document should specify all styling related rules and details of the design, such as colors, fonts, spacing and positioning. 

#### [Mockups to data map](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/mockups-to-data-map.md)
This artifact maps all the data elements like dimmensions and measures to objects/charts within the mockups.

#### [Functional Specifications Document](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/functional-specs.md)

Functional specs document describes the functionality and expected behaviors of all elements in the design. 

#### [Design Hand Off](../7-Design-Implementation-Support/Methods/design-handoff.md)

After the design is approved by client, the design team needs to communicate with the development team and provide supporting documents to make sure they fully understand the design they are going to build.

# Validate: Refine the prototype

The validate phase is used to collect feedback on the prototype and refine the design further.
Going into each validation test you should have a plan of what you are validating and how you
know if that is successful or not. To view a detailed exploration of validation techniques, view the [Axis Evaluation Toolkit](https://github.com/axisgroup/evaluation-toolkit).

## Input/Output

#### Inputs/Prerequisites:
###### High fidelity mockup
The high fidelity mockups are presented to users to collect feedback on them.

#### Outputs/Artifacts:
###### High fidelity mockup with iterations: 
The output is still high fidelity mockups but with changes implemented based on feedback received.

## Methods in Validate Phase

#### Stakeholder/User Review (Required)

Reviewing the design with stakeholders and users is the core activity in the validation phase. It allows the design team to observe user reactions to the design and to collect their feedback, so that they can better refine the design.


#### Technical Review (Required)

The designer needs to walk the developer through the design, and make sure everything is possible to build and raise red flags if anything takes extra effort. This step is especially important if an estimate of build document is one of the final deliverables.


#### Refine Design (Required)

The design team will take the feedback from the stakeholder/user review and implement changes to the prototype, and then circle back to the stakeholders and users to get further feedback or approval.


#### Future Recommendations

Sometimes the design team can't address all the needs of the users because of either time constraints or technology limitations. In such situations, it is helpful to document these unfulfilled needs as recommendations for future engagements. 


#### Usability Testing

This is the most used form of testing. Bring in 4â€“6 potential users and show
them the prototype that you made. Pay close attention to problems that they have
and be sure to follow a script to cover the assumptions that you are testing.
With their permission you can record these but it's best to see them as they happen.


#### Survey

This is a good way to reach a bunch of potential users and see their answers.
Create a simple form with [Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/about/)
or [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/).
Post the form to forums or other places that would have ideal users on it.
Make sure the form is easy to fill out
and open ended enough to collect qualitative information.
